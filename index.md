# News

**Sep 2023:**
TOPPE has been almost completely rewritten to make it a more accurate
interpreter of Pulseq files.
Please see the **Pulseq on GE manual** for more information.
To view a redacted version of that manual that contains minimal GE specific information, click 
[this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ejtXJfAWdNzXjMlz4Jo3KjVQU6BwGd5g/view?usp=drive_link).
If your institution owns a GE MRI scanner and you wish to receive the unredacted version of the manual,
contact Jon-Fredrik Nielsen at jfnielse@umich.edu.

We now recommend that you design your sequence in
[Pulseq](http://pulseq.github.io/), and then convert the .seq file to a .tar
file that can be run on a GE scanner with the TOPPE interpreter.
The manual describes how to perform this conversion.

As a result, most of the information on this page is obsolete,
and has been removed.

The interpreter (EPIC source code) is hosted in a
[separate repository](https://github.com/jfnielsen/TOPPEpsdSourceCode) -- for access, contact jfnielse@umich.edu.
Access is granted to all institutions that have signed the GE Research Community Sharing License.
