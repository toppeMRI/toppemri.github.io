\chapter{Tools for RF and gradient waveform design}

\section{Matlab scripts included in this distribution}
My own Matlab scripts for generating slice-selective RF pulses, balanced cartesian readouts, spoiler gradients, etc, are included in the \texttt{wavgen} directory in this distribution.
The code is provided as-is, and is undocumented at the moment. 


\section{John Pauly's RF pulse design code (Matlab)}
John Pauly has made his Shinnar-Le Roux code available for download at

\url{http://rsl.stanford.edu/research/software.html}

The code included in the \texttt{wavgen/tipdown} directory in this distribution uses Pauly's code to generate SLR slice-select pulses.


\section{Brian Hargreaves' spiral gradient design code (Matlab)}
Brian Hargreaves has made his spiral readout gradient design code available for download at

\section{Generating Pulseq files}

Pulseq provides tools for waveform and sequence creation, available on the Pulseq web page.
Alternatively, sequences can be designed, simulated, and exported in Pulseq (.seq) format using JEMRIS, available at
