This report describes the ``toppe.e'' pulse sequence (The End Of Pulse Programming), which allows the entire pulse sequence to be specified with several external files created with, e.g., Matlab.
This makes it possible to play arbitrary sequences of RF pulses, gradient waveforms, and data acquisition windows, and enables rapid sequence prototyping without the need for low-level EPIC programming.
